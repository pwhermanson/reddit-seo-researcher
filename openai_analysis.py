# ==================================================
# üìå How It Works - OpenAI Analysis
# ==================================================
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ The `analyze_with_openai()` function:
#    - Takes scraped website content as input.
#    - Sends it to OpenAI for analysis.
#    - Extracts structured business insights (Industry, Products, Audience, Competitors, etc.).
#    - Ensures OpenAI always returns a properly formatted response.
#    - Provides a default structured response if OpenAI fails.
#
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ The `get_relevant_subreddits()` function:
#    - Takes the industry summary as input.
#    - Sends it to OpenAI to identify **3 most relevant subreddits**.
#    - Extracts subreddit names in a clean format (`r/SubredditName`).
#    - Ensures results are structured correctly for use in other processes.
#
# ‚úÖ Debugging:
#    - Logs raw OpenAI responses for visibility.
#    - Ensures structured extraction before storing in Google Sheets.
#    - Provides fallback responses in case of API failure.
